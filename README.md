This repository serves as an organized archive of *data analysis materials* and *statistical outputs* prepared for *four client thesis projects* (undergraduate and postgraduate level) at the *University of Lagos*.

1.  *Institution* — University of Lagos  
2.  *Department* — Business Administration (with focus on Insurance)  
3.  *Degree Levels* — B.Sc. and M.Sc.  
4.  *Completion Years* — 2024 / 2025  
5.  *Primary Role* — Providing quantitative data analysis support, including SPSS processing, reliability testing, regression analysis, and report preparation for client theses.

The work focuses on *quantitative survey-based research*, where the core objective was to *investigate relationships between variables* using statistical methods (primarily regression analysis in SPSS/PSPP). Each client provided their own survey data (likely collected via Google Forms or similar), with varying sample sizes.

### Key Features of the Work

1.  *Research Design* — Quantitative, survey-based  
2.  *Main Analytical Tool* — IBM SPSS Statistics (or PSPP)  
3.  *Core Analyses Performed*:
  - Regression analysis (testing independent variables against dependent variables and vice versa)
  - Reliability testing (e.g., Cronbach's Alpha for scale validation)
  - Descriptive statistics and data presentation
4.  *Outputs Delivered*:
  - Narrative data presentation and analysis (in Microsoft Word)
  - SPSS statistical results exported as PDF reports

### Repository Organization

Materials are grouped by *client* (anonymized as "client 1" through "client 4") to maintain privacy and ethical standards. Sensitive or personally identifiable information has been removed or redacted where necessary.

Current folder contents include:
1. *client 1* → Data presentation & analysis write-up (.docx)
2.  *client 2* → Consolidated SPSS results (.pdf)
3.  *client 3* → SPSS reliability test outputs (.pdf)
4.  *client 4* → Full SPSS report / summary (.pdf)

This structure allows easy navigation to specific client deliverables and demonstrates a consistent workflow for thesis data analysis support.

### Who This Repository Is For

- Students or researchers looking for examples of *SPSS output organization* and *regression-based thesis analysis* in business/insurance contexts  
- Peers interested in how survey data is processed, tested for reliability, and reported  
- Potential collaborators or clients seeking similar quantitative analysis assistance
